## I use Arch (and Hyprland) btw
Make sure you are running `Hyprland`, and the following are installed:

`# pacman -S zsh`

`# pacman -S kitty`

`$ yay -S walker-bin`

`$ yay -S ashell`



## Vim
`vim-plug` needs to be installed to manage plugins. Use the command found in the [installation instructions
](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug?tab=readme-ov-file#unix)

_I prefer not doing the automated install on vim load to decrease startup times, and to keep vim usable in emergency situations_ 

Install the plugins by running `:PlugInstall`
